# MVP-App-TestHarness

A simple app that shows the endpoint of the workflow of the future ABC app.
To run the current version of this app

Android: Only an Android build can be directly downloaded from this project. The .apk is located in /build/android/

PWA (Progress Web app): It must be hosted on a website and the URL is http://abcbe-mvp-test-harness.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

iOS: Apple requires notarization. During development, each iOS revision is notarized and distributed via TestFlight.

## Standardization and Quality Checks

### Linting

This repo uses [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) to detect and prevent potential issues using static analysis.

ESlint will run automatically as a pre-commit hook anytime you attempt to make a commit. If it detects any problems, it will prevent the commit and alert you to the issue. Once remediated, you should be able to commit cleanly.

To run ESlint manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Formatting

This repo uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure standardized formatting rules across the entire codebase.

It's generally a good idea to configure your IDE to format whenever you make a change to a file. If you're using VS Code, you should install the [Prettier extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and enable [format on save](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_format-on-save).

As an additional check, Prettier will run automatically as a pre-commit hook anytime you attempt to make a commit. Any files you have changed will be auto-formatted and added to your commit.

To run Prettier manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run format:write # writes all formatting changes to disk
npm run format:write # will fail if more than one file is improperly formatted
```

### Unit testing

This repo uses [Karma](https://angular.io/guide/testing) for unit testing.

To run unit tests manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run test
```

Unit tests will fail if any tests fail, or if code coverage drops below the enforced thresholds. Generally, ideal code coverage levels (for statements/branches/functions/lines) would be around 80%; however, this repo has been set to

To view detailed coverage reports, run the unit tests and then load `./coverage/index.html` in a web browser. This will allow you to view specific coverage information for any file in the repo.

### Integration testing

This repo uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for integration testing.

To run integration tests manually, have the development server running (`npm run start`), then execute the following:

```bash
npm run e2e
```
