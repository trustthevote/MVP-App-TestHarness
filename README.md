## Standardization and Quality Checks

### Linting

This repo uses [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) to detect and prevent potential issues using static analysis.

ESlint will run automatically as a pre-commit hook anytime you attempt to make a commit. If it detects any problems, it will prevent the commit and alert you to the issue. Once remediated, you should be able to commit cleanly.

To run ESlint manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Formatting

This repo uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure standardized formatting rules across the entire codebase.

It's generally a good idea to configure your IDE to format whenever you make a change to a file. If you're using VS Code, you should install the [Prettier extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and enable [format on save](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_format-on-save).

As an additional check, Prettier will run automatically as a pre-commit hook anytime you attempt to make a commit. Any files you have changed will be auto-formatted and added to your commit.

To run Prettier manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run format:write # writes all formatting changes to disk
npm run format:write # will fail if more than one file is improperly formatted
```

### Unit testing

This repo uses [Karma](https://angular.io/guide/testing) for unit testing.

To run unit tests manually, execute the following:

```bash
npm run test
```
